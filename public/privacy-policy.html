  <h1>Massari Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated: December 26, 2019</strong></p>
  <p>Massari is a mobile application wallet Project Diaspora (“Project Diaspora” or “we” or “us” or “our”) 
    which allows users to broadcast messages &amp; transactions and view addresses &amp; information that are part of
    the Network (the “App” or ”Massari”). This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) helps explain how we collect, use,
    store, and protect your information when you use the App, our developer software, or our website at <a
      href="https://massari.app/">https://massari.app/</a> (collectively the “Services”). Please also
    read <a href="/terms-of-service.html">Massari’s Terms of Service</a> (the “Terms”),
    which describe the terms under which you use the Services.</p>
  <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
  <p>We receive or collect information when we operate and provide our Services, including when you install, access, or
    use our Services.</p>
  <p><strong>Information you provide</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Your Account Information</strong> - In order to create a Massari account, you will provide us
        with a username. You may also voluntarily add other information, such as a profile name, profile picture,
        biography, or location.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Your Transactions</strong> - Your Network private key, which you utilize to access your Ethereum funds
        and initiate transactions, is stored only on your own device. However, to facilitate your transactions and
        provide you with your Ethereum account balance, we store the Network public key address associated with your
        Network private key.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Customer Support</strong> - We may collect additional information you may disclose to our customer
        support team.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How We Use The Information We Collect</h3>
  <p>Our primary purpose in collecting information is to to help us operate, provide, improve, customize, support, and
    market our Services. We may use your information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide the Services and customer support you request;</li>
    <li>Verify your account;</li>
    <li>Resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems;</li>
    <li>Prevent and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and/or violations of our posted Terms;
    </li>
    <li>Customize, measure, and improve the Services and the content and layout of our application; and</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Marketing</h3>
  <p>We will never sell or rent your information to third parties.</p>
  <h3>How Your Information Is Shared With
    Other Massari Users</h3>
  <p>If you use your account to engage in a transaction with another user, that user will have
    access to your transaction information, respectively. Users with whom you interact with may store
    or re-share your information with others, on or off of our Services.</p>
  <h3>How We Share Information With Third Parties</h3>
  <p>We work with third-party providers to help us operate, provide, improve, customize, support, and market our
    Services. For example, we work with companies to distribute our apps, provide our infrastructure, delivery, and
    other systems. These providers may provide us information about you in certain circumstances; for example, app
    stores may provide us reports to help us diagnose and fix service issues.</p>
  <p>We may also share information with law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order, or similar legal procedure; or</li>
    <li>We believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or
      financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our Terms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Finally, we may share information with companies or other entities that we plan to merge with or be acquired by.
    Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with
    respect to your personal information. You will receive prior notice of any change in applicable policy.</p>
  <h3>How you can access or change your information</h3>
  <p>You may delete your Massari account at any time. When you delete your account, any of your other information
    we no longer need to operate and provide our Services. Please also note that Massari does not ever store your Network
    private key, so if you delete the application, make sure you have a copy of your private key elsewhere so that you may
    continue to access your Network funds. We do provide a feature within the App that will display your locally stored
    private key stored to you in readable form so that you may write it down and keep a copy of the key off of your 
    device.</p>
  <h3>Our Global Operations</h3>
  <p>You agree to our information practices, including the collection, use, processing, and sharing of your information
    as described in this Privacy Policy, as well as the transfer and processing of your information to the United States
    and other countries globally where we have or use facilities, service providers, or partners, regardless of where
    you use our Services.</p>
  <p>You acknowledge that the laws, regulations, and standards of the country in which your information is stored or
    processed may be different from those of your own country. However, we require our service providers to treat your
    information in strict confidence and use appropriate security measures to protect it. We also require them to uphold
    all obligations under this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <h3>Updates To Our Policy</h3>
  <p>We may amend or update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes to this policy
    by updating the last updated date at the top of this page, and we will provide you with explicit notice of material
    changes as required by law. Your continued use of our Services confirms your acceptance of our Privacy Policy, as
    amended. If you do not agree to our Privacy Policy, as amended, you must stop using our Services. We recommend that
    you visit this page frequently to check for changes.</p>
