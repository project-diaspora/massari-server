      href="https://massari.app/">https://massari.app/</a> (the <strong>“Site”</strong>) (collectively the

  <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
  <p><strong>Governing Law, Forum and Venue</strong></p>
  <p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be
    governed by the laws of the state of California in the United States, without regard to its conflict of laws
    provisions, If you are a user located in the United States or Canada, the terms in the “Special Arbitration
    Provision for United States or Canada Users” section below apply to you.</p>
  <p>If you are not located in the United States or
    Canada, you agree that you will resolve any claim you have with us relating to, arising out of, or in any way in
    connection with our Terms, us, or our Services (each, a “Dispute,” and together, “Disputes”) exclusively in the
    state courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District
    of California and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all
    such Disputes.</p>
  <p><strong>Special Arbitration Provision for United
      States or Canada Users</strong></p>
  <p>If you are a user located in the United States or
    Canada, you and Project Diaspora agree that any Dispute <strong>shall be finally settled in binding arbitration, on an
      individual basis, in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s rules for arbitration of
      consumer-related disputes (accessible at <a
        href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules">https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules</a>) and you and Project Diaspora
      hereby expressly waive trial by jury and right to participate in a class action lawsuit, private attorney general
      actions, or class-wide arbitration,</strong> except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual
    action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent
    jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s
    copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the
    foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”). The exclusive jurisdiction of an IP Protection Action shall be
    the courts of San Francisco, California and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the
    purpose of litigating IP Protection Actions.</p>
  <p>The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16,
    fully applies to the arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take
    place in the county or parish in which you reside, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language.
    The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys’ fees
    when authorized by law, and the arbitral decision may be entered as a judgement and enforced in any court of law. At
    your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and
    determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce
    this agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees.</p>
  <p>If the arbitrator(s) or arbitration administrator
    would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent
    such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a
    court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator’s rules or
    applicable law. Apart from the foregoing, each Party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such as
    attorney fees that the Party may incur. If a court decides that any provision of this Special Arbitration Provision
    is invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the other parts of this Special Arbitration
    Provision shall still apply. In any case, the remainder of this User Agreement, will continue to apply.</p>
